The total number of casualties remains disputed. Estimates of reduced life expectancy as a result of radiation released are highly uncertain and vary from 4,000 people in a United Nations study up to 200,000 reported by a Greenpeace study. During the accident, steam-blast effects caused two deaths within the facility: one immediately after the explosion and the other compounded by a lethal dose of ionizing radiation. Over the coming days and weeks, 134 servicemen were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome (ARS), of whom 28 firemen and employees died within months. Additionally, approximately 14 radiation-induced cancer deaths among this group of 134 hospitalized survivors were to follow within the next 10 years. Among the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011. Additional time and research is required to definitively determine the elevated relative risk of cancer among the surviving employees, those that were initially hospitalized with ARS, and the population at large.
