The album artwork was created by artist Ed Repka, who previously had done the cover for Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? in 1986. It references "Hangar 18", and depicts band mascot Vic Rattlehead and world leaders of the era viewing an alien body. The depicted world leaders, left to right, are British Prime Minister John Major (although the identity is disputed), Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, West German President (and later President of a reunified Germany) Richard von Weizs√§cker, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and U.S. President George H.W. Bush. In addition to creating the album's cover, Repka also supplied artwork for the album's two singles.
