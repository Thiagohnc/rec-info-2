The Chernobyl accident is considered the most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a "level 7 major accident", the maximum classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale; the other was the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. The struggle to safeguard against scenarios that were perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe, together with later decontamination efforts of the surroundings, ultimately involved over 500,000 liquidators and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles (roughly $30 billion USD in 1986, or $68 billion USD in 2019 adjusted for inflation).
