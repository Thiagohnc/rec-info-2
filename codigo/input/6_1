The accident occurred during a safety test on a common Soviet reactor type - the RBMK nuclear power reactor. The test, a simulation of an electrical power outage, was to aid the development of a safety procedure for keeping reactor cooling water circulating until the emergency generators could provide power. This gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem which could cause reactor core overheating. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982 but had failed to provide a solution. On the fourth occasion, which became catastrophic, the test had been delayed by ten hours, and the reactor operating shift that had specifically prepared for the test procedure was replaced by the next shift. The test supervisor then failed to follow the test procedure, creating unstable operating conditions which, combined with inherent RBMK reactor design flaws and the intentional disabling of several emergency safety systems, resulted in an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction. A huge amount of energy was suddenly released, which vapourised superheated cooling water, rupturing the reactor pressure vessel in a highly destructive steam explosion, which was instantly followed by an open-air reactor core fire.
