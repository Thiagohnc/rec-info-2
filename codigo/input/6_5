The remains of the No. 4 reactor building were soon enclosed in the sarcophagus, a large shelter designed to reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and to protect the site from further weathering. This was rapidly built and was finished by December 1986, when the reactor was entering the cold shutdown phase. The shelter also provided radiological protection for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station, with No. 3 continuing to produce electricity until 2000. Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, both it and the No. 4 reactor were further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a larger, state of the art enclosure, designed and built by an international team. This structure has the ability to facilitate the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive contamination.
